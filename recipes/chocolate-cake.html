    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This chocolate cake is made with cocoa and hot coffee. It has been in my family forever. The secret is to not overbake it — that will ruin a chocolate cake every time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup hot, strong coffee</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and baking soda. Add oil, milk, eggs, and vanilla; mix until smooth. Stir in hot coffee last. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.</li>
        </ol>
