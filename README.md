# odin-recipes

[The very first project from The Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)  
The goal is to build a simple recipe website. It should demonstrate the HTML knowledge earned through the lessons. It might not look pretty, but the project will be revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.
